# GenericRepoMongoDB
Basic example of how to create generic repositories with [MongoDB driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/csharp/).

This can help implementing a parallel "NoSQL" ORM for mongodb in an already existing EF application. This was used to implement the possibility to use both SQL and NoSQL at the same time [this PR on JHipster.NET](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore/pull/717).
